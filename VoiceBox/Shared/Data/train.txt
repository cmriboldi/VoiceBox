Sly Fox

Mr. Rabbit sat on his front porch rocking, eating a great big carrot,
and looking.

"Looks like Sly Fox coming down the road," he said to himself, walking
to the end of the porch. Shading his eyes with his paws, he exclaimed, "It
is Sly Fox."

"Good morning Mr. Rabbit," cried Sly Fox, as he walked across the yard.
"Good morning," replied Mr. Rabbit, a slight frown on his face.

"Well," said Sly Fox, "as I haven't seen you in so long a time, thought
I would stop and chat a while."

Mr. Rabbit could not be rude in his own home, even to an enemy, so he
offered Sly Fox a seat on the porch.

"Take a chair," he said politely.     But Sly Fox did not stay long, and as
he was leaving, he asked: "Mr. Rabbit, my mother is having a good dinner
tonight. Won't you, Mrs. Rabbit, and your three little rabs come to dinner
with me?"

Oh, thought Mr. Rabbit, he knows about my little rabs and wants to take
us off to eat us. He pretended to be disappointed as he replied: "Sorry, Sly
Fox, we have an engagement for today, but if you want us we can come
tomorrow."

At this Sly Fox chuckled inwardly, and readily agreed to come for them
the next day. Wishing Mr. Rabbit "Good day", he trotted on down the road
toward his home.

As soon as he was out of sight, Mr. Rabbit ran into his house and called
Mrs. Rabbit. "Get all our things together," he said, "and put rubber boots
on our little rabs. We have to move quickly to the Piney Woods across the
brook. Old Sly Fox has found our home and will destroy us."

In no time at all the Rabbit family had moved, and the little rabs were
delighted with their new home. A woodland of towering pines it was, the
ground covered with pine needles which made a soft carpeting. The wind made
music in the pine trees, birds sang, and the fragrance of flowers filled the
air. They found a huge hollow tree where Mr. Rabbit burrowed deep and made
them a cozy home. Squirrels had left nuts hidden around in the old tree.
Owls hooted throughout the night, crickets chirped merrily.

Next morning old Sly Fox knocked on the door where he had left Mr.
Rabbit. Mrs. Hedgehog answered the door. "Good morning, Mrs. Hedgehog. Is
Mr. Rabbit in?" inquired Sly Fox with a wicked grin and a cunning look in
his eyes.

"No," replied Mrs. Eedgehog, none too cordially. "The Rabbit family
moved to parts unknown right after you left yesterday."

"Ah," exclaimed old Sly Fox, "Mr. Rabbit and family were going to have
dinner with me. My mother has planned a real feast. Why don't you come and
enjoy it with us?"

"Oh," replied Mrs. Hedgehog, smacking her lips and thinking of all the
goodies, "I have just moved in and there is so much to do! Why not let it go
until tomorrow?"

"Do you like nice young grasshoppers?" asked Sly Fox softly.

"Do I? Nothing so good as tender young grasshoppers," answered Mrs.
Hedgehog, fairly dribbling at the mouth at the thought of such a dainty.

"Well," said Sly Fox, "we pass a field where there are any number of
them. Come get in this sack, and when I stop in the field we will open the
sack and rake in all of them we want. Mother will bake them with apples and
they will be deilicious!" This was too much for greedy Mrs. Hedgehog to
resist, so in the sack she went. Sly Fox with a grin grabbed the sack, threw
it over his shoulder and trotted toward home.     After going a long way, Mrs.
Hedgehog became suspicious and cried, "How long before we reach that field
of grasshoppers?"

"Why, you silly, greedy hedgehog, there is no field of grasshoppers for
you. I am going to eat you for my dinner. It's you with apple dumplings that
my mother will bake."

Every hair on Mrs. Hedgehog's head stood on end with fright. Oh, how
foolish she had been! Her greed had trapped her. If only she had stayed home
and straightened her house and cooked her own dinner, she would not have
been in this sack to be eaten by Sly Fox. Greediness never pays, she thought
to herself.

Sly Fox became tired, and as a slight rain had begun to fall, he looked
for a dry place to sit down. Throwing the sack to the ground and chuckling
at the thought of sitting on Mrs. Hedgehog, he dropped heavily upon the
sack.

"Wow, Wow!" he cried, jumping quickly up, for Mrs. Hedgehog shot her
sharp quills into him with all her might.

Sly Fox ran to and fro trying to pull out the quills, but they had gone
too deep. Home he ran, screaming to his mother. Old Mother Fox threw him
over a log and began pulling out the quills, at the same time calling to a
neighbor fox to bring some honey to put on the places where the quills had
been.

Mrs. Hedgehog crawled out of the bag and began walking slowly toward
home. She thought to herself that never again would she be so greedy and
allow herself to be fooled by Sly Fox or any one else.

Meanwhile, Mr. Rabbit and family were living happily in Piney Woods. The
little rabs played on the crystal clear brook that ran through the woods,
wading, sailing little leaf boats, and trying to catch the silvery minnows
darting here and there.

Late one evening Papa and Mama Rabbit were sitting before the cozy fire
talking. Papa Rabbit had on his house robe and bedroom slippers, reading the
newspaper. Every now and then he looked over his spectacles lovingly at
dainty little Mama Rabbit, dressed in a flowered housecoat and red slippers
and knitting little socks for the little rabs.

"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!" came suddenly to their ears.

"Sly Fox!" whispered Papa Rabbit, his face now full of concern and
alarm.

"Yes," agreed Mama Rabbit, her voice trembling with fright.

"Go cover the little rabs with straw and tell them to be very, very
quiet," instructed Papa Rabbit.

Mrs. Rabbit quickly covered the little rabs and cautioned them to be as
quiet as mice. Since they were well behaved and obedient little rabs, they
did just as their mother told them.

"I left my big stick beside the old oak tree," cried Papa Rabbit under
his breath. "What shall we do?"

"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!" went Sly Fox again, scratching up the earth by
the old hollow tree as he began to dig furiously. The poor little Rabbit
family sat still and frightened, their hearts thumping, their paws shaking,
and their eyes bulging with panic. Suddenly in the distance they heard the
"Toot! Toot!Toot!" of horns, and the "Woof! Woof! Woof!" of barking dogs.

Papa Rabbit whispered, "Fox hunters!" as his heart gave a bound of
relief.

Nearer and nearer came the baying of the hounds and the music of the
horns. Old Sly Fox was so busily digging that he failed to hear at first,
but suddenly he stopped digging, and threw back his ears to listen. Then he
quickly jumped away from the log where the Rabbit family lived and started
running.

But the hounds were right after him, baying loudly with all their might.
The horses' feet beat out an excited rhythm as the red-coated fox hunters
urged them on in the chase. Up hill, over the meadows they ran.

Sly Fox was now running for his life, but the dogs were getting closer
and closer. He jumped across the brook and spied a hole among some bushes.
Into this he slid, and as the dogs went down the side of the stream of water
before they jumped across they lost his scent. Sly Fox quickly ran out of
the hole and took off in the opposite direction from the way the dogs were
going. He had been so frightened and so near death that he resolved to
himself never to bother the Rabbit family again.

Meanwhile, when Papa Rabbit had heard the hounds start the chase, he
turned to Mama Rabbit and cried, "Safe at last! Call our little rabs for
prayers of thanksgiving and praise to our Father which art in heaven."

After prayers, Mama Rabbit hustled about making mint tea for her and
Papa Rabbit, and hot chocolate piled high with whipped cream for the little
rabs. After that time they Lived happily among the great whispering pines,
never bothered by old Sly Fox.

100 WEST BY 53 NORTH

North of 53. A magic phrase. Spoken, mumbled or thought
inwardly by thousands of souls venturing northward. An
imaginary line, shown only on maps and labelled 53 degrees.
It's presence indicated to highway travellers by road side
signs.
A division of territory as distinct in the mind as any
international border.
If you have not been "North of 53", you have not been
north!
Travellers and writers, poets and pilots, have
contributed to the lore of the north. The rigors of life in
the bush are told in tales of man eating mosquitoes, of
murderous hordes of black flies, of the lumps of flesh
carried away by the giant bull dog flies.
The stories of record breaking trout, walleye, and pike
are legion. There are tales of sights and sounds heard deep
in the spruce forests:
The crashing of moose, tearing through brush and
breaking down trees. The drumming of grouse. The incessant
hum of insects. The cackling quackery of ducks feeding on
quiet ponds and placid bays.
Once heard, the intermittent song of the loon is never
forgotten. It's voice the signature of authenticity of a
northern scene.
If the wildlife in the northern bush land seems
different than found elsewhere, so is the life of man. It
takes a special breed of person to live in the north. The
farther one travels, the more this becomes apparent. The
Southerner, whether on his first or fiftieth trip north of
53, never really becomes aware of the implications of
northern living.
Generally, the owners of "cottages" on southern lakes
have more amenities at hand for a weekend of "roughing it"
than most northern dwellers have on a year round basis.
The modern cabin on a lake shore near a large
metropolitan center is equipped with electric service, a
telephone, paved roads, natural gas pipelines, and cable
television.
Nearby are services that provide food, fuel, repairs,
and entertainment. Drivein theaters and fast food chains
abound. Waterfront businesses have docks built for those
arriving by boat to do their shopping, laundry, or to
transfer suitcases from the family car. The local merchants
deliver goods to the cabin by road or by water.
Entrepreneurs make a businesss of servicing and maintaining
cabins during the owners absence in the off seasons.
Most of these "cottages", whether on the lake shore, or
located five well paved streets from the water, rival the
homes of many city dwellers. These lake side communities,
although seasonal, differ little from the urban living from
which they offer escape.
Look at an average northern community. Study and
compare the standards with those of urban areas and their
nearby lake side retreats.
There are no local bus services. If the car doesn't
start you either walk, or call a taxi. Yes, most areas do
have a taxi service of one kind or another. Even if it's a
ride in the back of some one's pick up truck.
Mail delivery is unknown. A pleasant stroll in
midsummer is contrasted by an ordeal in life threatening
conditions during winter.
House to house delivery of milk and bread is
nonexistent. Perhaps newspapers are delivered, but it
requires a family effort, especially in winter.
Bus, rail and scheduled air services to nearby
settlements is severely restricted, if available at all.
Many small taxi companies exist because of the large fares
collected in the transport of natives to and from the
reserves.
Although diminishing in recent years, the bushpilot and
charter aircraft still play a large role in northern
transportation.
The pilots of these small aircraft learn to live with
conditions that would keep their southern colleagues on the
ground.
In summer they fly float equipped aircraft. They are
busy hauling trappers, fishermen, freight, fish, furs, and
supplies to and from the reserves, fish camps, traplines,
logging areas, and small settlements.
In the fall, when the ice is too thin for skis, yet too
thick for floats, they change the aircraft to wheel
equipment. Changing to skis when ice conditions permit.
Winter flying presents problems that most pilots never
hear of. Temperatures exceeding 40 below zero, blowing snow,
ice crystals, and whiteouts. All these challenge the pilot
in their daily work. The preheating of engines to coax them
to life. The problem of congealed oil in propeller pitch
mechanisms, and fueling with super cooled gasoline are
regular chores.
The ski-equipped aircraft must be tied down with ropes
that are frozen into holes in the four foot ice. The skis
must be lifted or run onto boards or poles to prevent them
freezing into the ice.
Pilots and passengers must wear heavy arctic clothing
as few aircraft have cabin heat systems capable of coping
with the cold. Aircraft batteries are removed at the end of
each day of flying to ensure maximum efficiency the next
day. Wings and engines are covered to stop the ingress of
snow and the build up of frost on the flight surfaces.
Gasoline fueled blow-pots are often carried to provide
engine preheat to ensure starting. The oil in these engines
gets so thick at minus 40 to 50 degrees that the engine
cannot be turned. This writer has done chin-ups on the
propeller of a coldsoaked Cessna which flew the next day
after preheating.
The northern airports lack any degree of services in
comparison to those farther south. Fuel is usually available
if you can locate the operator. Some of the larger
communities may have a pay telephone at the airstrip, but
the normal procedure is to buzz the town on arrival. This
lets the people know you are landing and usually someone
will head out to the strip to meet you.
Unless you are a regular customer, all transactions for
fuel and oil are on a cash basis. Cheques are nearly useless
in a village without a bank. Credit to a stranger is
foolhardy.
During the grip of winter, the snowmobile is the major
mode of transport in all but the largest of settlements. In
many places that do have roads in winter, vehicles are left
running 24 hours a day. If allowed to get cold, it may take
many hours of effort to restart balky engines.
Most northern residents enjoy the winter months. The
change  in seasons brings on a change in activities. The
boats and motors are stored away with the lawnmowers and
garden chairs. The snowmobiles are tuned up, ice-fishing
shacks are towed onto lakes and rivers. The blades of gas-
powered ice augers are sharpened. The fishermen flock to
their favorite spots and drill holes through ice up to four
feet thick.
Whether in the comfort of a shack with a woodburning
stove glowing in the center, or huddled on the ice in the
lee of a snowmobile, they normally take a good catch.
Walleye, trout, pike, tullibee and whitefish as well as
perch, burbot, catfish and bass are plentiful. The most
popular bait is minnows, some use sucker-belly, or net bags
of trout eggs. Others use metal spoons or large bucktail
flies, lead-headed jigging lures, or just snelled hooks. As
in summer, the best bait is whatever the fish are taking at
the time.
Moose hunting is another favorite sport, especially in
the colder weather when the moose are on the move for food
and warmth. The hunter faces problems similar to the pilot
with his equipment. The extreme temperatures require that
his snowmachine be kept in top condition if it is to start
after a day of hunting. Once started it must be dependable.
A life and death situation could develop if the machine
breaks down while 40 or 50 miles from home.
Even his rifle requires special care. A bolt covered
with heavy grease will freeze solid in the cold. The firing
pin may not move when struck by the hammer. Many a moose and
bear lived to face another day because a hunter's weapon
failed to operate.
Other outdoor activities include cross country skiing,
snowmobiling, and racing dog teams. These sports are
included in the many winter festivals held each year.
As spring arrives, the winter equipment is stored away
and once again the boats and motors are brought out. Wagers
are made on the time and date of the break up of river ice.
The snow blowers, shovels, and skidoo suits are replaced
with lawn mowers, rakes, and bathing suits.
The pussy willows blossom. The ducks and geese return
from their winter feeding grounds in the southern U.S.A..
The frogs begin to croak and the first battalions of
mosquitoes are hatched.
From the winter lows of 40 below zero, the mercury
climbs upward. The summer highs reach the 90's, sometimes
100 degrees. A fantastic differential of 140 degrees between
seasons.
Through the seasons, day to day life continues. The
sport and commercial fishing, the trapping and hunting. The
road building, home construction, and landscaping. The
pilots fly passengers and freight. They fly patrols on
hundreds of miles of hydro-electric transmission lines and
forest fire patrols. At regular intervals they carry
conservationists doing animal census. They transport tanks
of baby fish to restock the lakes. The seriously ill or
injured are taken to medical centers by MEDEVAC flights.
Other flights carry fishermen, and tourists.
Prospectors vie with geologists, botanists, biologists,
entomologists, and surveyors. All use the aircraft to see,
touch, smell, measure and record the wonders of the north.
The opening day of each hunting or fishing season is
heralded by the arrival of recreational vehicles of all
types. Trailers and vans, motorhomes and 4X4's arrive daily.
They carry or tow boats and motors, bicycles, motorcycles,
and ATVs. The "first-timers" fill the private and provincial
government campgrounds. The more experienced and
adventuresome travel logging roads and bush trails to
favorite lakes, rivers, and streams.
In town, the streets and parking lots are crammed with
vehicles and equipment.
Gasoline, food, booze, and fishing equipment are sold
in great quantities.
The hotels are full. Reservations were made months in
advance, some were made prior to leaving the year before.
For a few short weeks, during the prime spring fishing
period, every available camping spot is occupied.
As the summer wears on, the sportsmen recede and
tourists take their place. The cycle repeats annually.
Each year a number of travellers arrive in privately
owned aircraft. Piper Cub to Beechcraft. Taildragger to
bizjet. Most have been here before, to some it is a new
experience.
To a southern pilot, a trip north can be unnerving.
Accustomed to flying over a network of roads and railroad
tracks, always in contact with an airport or navigation aid,
they are seldom prepared for the realities of northern
flight.
Airports are hundreds of miles apart. In most cases
there are no roads or railways for navigation. At lower
altitudes, voice contact with an airport is an exception
rather than the rule.
Flight plans of course are mandatory. Map reading is
difficult. There are so many lakes, many of them the same
basic shape that a sharp eye must be kept on the map.
For seaplanes, the ever present danger of logs, rocks,
and reefs is amplified by the distance from civilization.
Flights must be carefully planned around suitable refueling
facilities.
The pilot of a private seaplane is in his own element
here. The pleasure of landing on a remote lake, its quiet
green waters undisturbed by others, is indescribable.
After securing the aircraft and setting up camp, the
true beauty of the north can be enjoyed.
Waters teeming with fish, are surrounded by wildlife of
all types. The smells of wood smoke and coffee mingling with
the sound of fresh fish sizzling in the frypan.
The songs of bird life. The cry of the loon. The
evening wail of coyotes and wolves. The whistle of wings as
ducks, geese, ravens, hawks, and eagles travel down the
shoreline. On the lakes are the wakes of passing beaver and
muskrat. The occasional warning smack of a beaver's tail on
the water as he senses danger.
The varied hues of trees, evergreen and deciduous. The
colors of windflowers. The taste of fresh wild strawberries,
raspberries, and blueberries.
The excitement of an evening sky dancing with a
dazzling display as the Aurora Borealis appears. The
"Northern Lights" are surrounded by stars, incredibly
brilliant against the black, smog free heavens.
Thoughts in the night.... Lying in your tent you hear
rustling noises. A twig snaps. Mouse or rabbit? Moose or
bear? Is the food secure? You visualize the food bundle,
securely tied to a tree branch, high above the ground.
The wind is rising, you can hear small waves breaking
on the shore. Is the airplane alright? Should you go and
check it?
What will the fishing be like in the morning? Will you
get another chance to land the big Walleye that you lost to
day. Or a bigger one?
A lone mosquito buzzes your ear. Somehow he has
penetrated the netting of your tent.
The cry of a loon is the last thing you hear. You sleep
peacefully until the songs of early morning bird life
announce the start of a new day.
But for the constant buzz-sting-slap of insect warfare,
you might be in heaven.
Far to the south, your friends and neighbors are also
facing a new day.
Howling dogs. Screaming kids. Squealing tires. The wail
of police and fire sirens. The reek of diesel fumes from
passing trucks and busses. Telephones jangle and typewriters
clatter. The work piles up.
Dissatisfied customers grumble. The boss looms
threateningly.
They jostle in line for a bus, then for coffee, then
for lunch. They fight traffic to get home.
The neighbor's dog has left a deposit on the lawn. The
children's toys are cluttering the driveway.
They sit down to a TV dinner and discuss your crazy
fishing trip.
The day to day life in the north does have it's
problems; if you happen to own a car for which there is no
local dealer, you may have to order parts from hundreds of
miles away and have them shipped in by bus or plane.
Meanwhile the car sits. The same applies to appliances,
tools, and so on.
There may not be a TV repairman in town. You must send
the set out for repairs, or, buy a new one. By mail order of
course. Providing your community has a TV station to begin
with.
Most northern communities have only one radio station.
The CBC. Some are augmented by local programming.
Other services may be difficult to obtain. For example,
a veterinarian may visit weekly, or monthly, or not at all.
Medical facilities are usually present to some extent, but
any serious illness or injury may require a MEDEVAC flight
to a distant city.
Fresh meat and produce become more of a problem in the
more remote areas. If road or rail service exists the
problem is not too acute. However, in many communities, the
only access is by air. In this event the shipment of
perishable commodities is dependant on space available on
the aircraft. The subsequent prices reflect the added cost
of the product.
On the subject of costs, heating a home with propane
may be five to seven times the cost of natural gas as in
southern homes. Food, gasoline, clothing, and appliances,
are considerably more expensive in the north. Of course the
more remote the location the higher the price.
On a trip into the high arctic a few years ago the
prices ran like this:

Hotel bed $100.00 per night,  per man

Breakfast (2 eggs, 2 toast,
2 bacon, and 2 coffee)
$12.00

Avgas $7.00 per gallon

But then, when you are 250 miles north of the arctic
circle, you expect to pay higher prices.
Why then, do people live in the north?
For the natives it is a matter of ancestry. For many
whites it is also ancestry. To some, they were born there.
Their parents having moved north for employment reasons.
Some are transients, following construction jobs and
other seasonal employment. Others, working for large
corporations or government, are transferred north as a job
requirement.
Life in the north is definitely different. A person
accustomed to life in a large city may  not endure the
rigors involved. They give it up and move south.
Many people, such as myself, move north for an extended
period. In our case it was 10 years. We adapted to the way
of life. We enjoyed the hunting and fishing.
Owning our own aircraft, we were able to travel more
independently than our neighbors. We enjoyed all the great
outdoors had to offer. We learned to adjust to the lack of
night life, and other amenities.
When 10 years had passed, and our children were adults,
we took stock of our situation.
We were stuck in a rut. The same rut that most of the
townspeople were in. Our lives centered around hunting,
fishing, the Post Office, and the TV set.
We decided it was a case of moving now, or possibly
remaining in the north for the rest of our lives.

We left in February of 1984!

We miss the delicious fresh fish from cold clear lakes.
We miss the taste of thick moose steaks, moosemeat sausages,
fresh smoked lake trout, and pancakes with fresh, wild
blueberries. We miss the freedom afforded by a short flight
to a secluded lake shore.
The fishing and hunting within 10 miles of our northern
home was superb. The friendship and camaraderie of our
neighbors was great.
We are happy to have had the opportunity to experience
northern life. But, as we approached the midpoint of our
lives, we wanted to return to civilization. To pick up where
we had left off. To enjoy the supermarkets, and shopping
malls, the fancy restaurants, and gourmet foods. We wanted
to be closer to the center of things, a few hours drive from
a major city rather than an all day trip.
We returned to old friends, and new neighbors. New
stores, and home mail delivery. Lower prices. Broader
choices. More to do and see. More TV channels. Several radio
stations, and newspapers.
We can drive east or west besides north and south. We
can dance to live music and eat in restaurants of many
nationalities.

In short, we are back to civilization

The Adveniure of the Three Gables

I don't think that any of my adventures with Mr. Sherlock
Holmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that
which I associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes
for some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his
activities had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that
morning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn
low armchair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down
with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our
visitor arrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it would
give a clearer impression of what occurred.
The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the
room. He would have been a comic figure if he had not been
terrific, for he was dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a
flowing salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flattened nose
were thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering
gleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other.
"Which of you gen'l'men is Masser Holmes?" he asked.
Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.
"Oh! it's you, is it?" said our visitor, coming with an un-
pleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. "See here,
Masser Holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks' busi-
ness. Leave folks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser
Holmes?"
"Keep on talking," said Holmes. "It's fine."
"Oh! it's fine, is it?" growled the savage. "It won't be so
damn fine if I have to trim you up a bit. I've handled your kind
before now, and they didn't look fine when I was through with
them. Look at that, Masser Holmes!"
He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's
nose. Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest.
"Were you born so?" he asked. "Or did it come by degrees?"
It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have
been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. In
any case, our visitor's manner became less flamboyant.
"Well, I've given you fair warnin'," said he. "I've a friend
that's interested out Harrow way -- you know what I'm meaning --
and he don't intend to have no buttin' in by you. Got that? You
ain't the law, and I ain't the law either, and if you come in I'll
be on hand also. Don't you forget it."
"I've wanted to meet you for some time," said Holmes. "I
won't ask you to sit down, for I don't like the smell of you, but
aren't you Steve Dixie, the bruiser?"
"That's my name, Masser Holmes, and you'll get put through
it for sure if you give me any lip."
"It is certainly the last thing you need," said Holmes, staring
at our visitor's hideous mouth. "But it was the killing of young
Perkins outside the Holborn -- Bar What! you're not going?"
The negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. "I won't
listen to no such talk," said he. "What have I to do with this 'ere
Perkins, Masser Holmes? I was trainin' at the Bull Ring in
Birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble."
"Yes, you'll tell the magistrate about it, Steve," said Holmes.
"I've been watching you and Barney Stockdale --"
"So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes --"
"That's enough. Get out of it. I'll pick you up when I want
you."
"Good-mornin', Masser Holmes. I hope there ain't no hard
feelin's about this 'ere visit?"
"There will be unless you tell me who sent you."
"Why, there ain't no secret about that, Masser Holmes. It was
that same gen'l'man that you have just done gone mention."
"And who set him on to it?"
"S'elp me. I don't know, Masser Holmes. He just say,
'Steve, you go see Mr. Holmes, and tell him his life ain't
safe if he go down Harrow way.' That's the whole truth."
Without waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted
out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered.
Holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle.
"I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head,
Watson. I observed your manoeuvres with the poker. But he is
really rather a harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blus-
tering baby, and easily cowed, as you have seen. He is one
of the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some dirty
work of late which I may clear up when I have time. His
immediate principal, Barney, is a more astute person. They
specialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like. What I want
to know is, who is at the back of them on this panicular
occasion?"
"But why do they want to intimidate you?"
"It is this Harrow Weald case. It decides me to look into the
matter, for if it is worth anyone's while to take so much trouble,
there must be something in it."
"But what is it?"
"I was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude.
Here is Mrs. Maberley's note. If you care to come with me we
will wire her and go out at once."

DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES [I read]:
I have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me
in connection with this house, and I should much value your
advice. You would find me at home any time to-morrow.
The house is within a short walk of the Weald Station. I
believe that my late husband, Mortimer Maberley, was one
of your early clients.
Yours faithfully,
MARY MABERLEY.

The address was "The Three Gables, Harrow Weald."
"So that's that!" said Holmes. "And now, if you can spare
the time, Watson, we will get upon our way."
A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the
house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of
undeveloped grassland. Three small projections above. the upper
windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind was a
grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of
the place was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the
house to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a
most engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refine-
ment and culture.
"I remember your husband well, madam," said Holmes,
"though it is some years since he used my services in some
trifling matter."
"Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my
son Douglas."
Holmes looked at her with great interest.
"Dear me! Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley? I knew
him slightly. But of course all London knew him. What a
magnificent creature he was! Where is he now?"
"Dead, Mr. Holmes, dead! He was attache at Rome, and he
died there of pneumonia last month."
"I am sorry. One could not connect death with such a man. I
have never known anyone so vitally alive. He lived intensely --
every fibre of him!"
"Too intensely, Mr. Holmes. That was the ruin of him. You
remember him as he was -- debonair and splendid. You did not
see the moody, morose, brooding creature into which he devel-
oped. His heart was broken. In a single month I seemed to see
my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man."
"A love affair -- a woman?"
"Or a fiend. Well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that I
asked you to come, Mr. Holmes."
"Dr. Watson and I are at your service."
"There have been some very strange happenings. I have been
in this house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a
retired life I have seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I
had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. He
said that this house would exactly suit a client of his, and that if I
would part with it money would be no object. It seemed to me
very strange as there are several empty houses on the market
which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I was interested
in what he said. I therefore named a price which was five
hundred pounds more than I gave. He at once closed with the
offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as
well and would I put a price upon it. Some of this furniture is
from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I
named a good round sum. To this also he at once agreed. I had
always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that
it really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of
my life.
"Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out.
Luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in
Harrow. He said to me, 'This is a very strange document. Are
you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take anything
out of the house -- not even your own private possessions?' When
the man came again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said
that I meant only to sell the furniture.
" 'No, no, everything,' said he.
" 'But my clothes? My jewels?'
" 'Well, well, some concession might be made for your per-
sonal effects. But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked.
My client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own
way of doing things. It is everything or nothing with him.'
" 'Then it must be nothing,' said I. And there the matter was
left, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I
thought --"
Here we had a very extraordinary interruption.
Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he strode across the
room, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman
whom he had seized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly
struggle like some huge awkward chicken, torn, squawking, out
of its coop.
"Leave me alone! What are you a-doin' of?" she screeched.
"Why, Susan, what is this?"
"Well, ma'am, I was comin' in to ask if the visitors was
stayin' for lunch when this man jumped out at me."
"I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did
not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. Just a little
wheezy, Susan, are you not? You breathe too heavily for that
kind of work."
Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. "Who
be you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin' me about like
this?"
"It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your
presence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, mention to anyone that you
were going to write to me and consult me?"
"No, Mr. Holmes, I did not."
"Who posted your letter?"
"Susan did."
"Exactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent
a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from
me?"
"It's a lie. I sent no message."
"Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know.
It's a wicked thing to tell fibs. Whom did you tell?"
"Susan!" cried her mistress, "I believe you are a bad, treach-
erous woman. I remember now that I saw you speaking to
someone over the hedge."
"That was my own business," said the woman sullenly.
"Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you
spoke?" said Holmes.
"Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?"
"I was not sure, but I know now. Well now, Susan, it will be
worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of
Barney."
"Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every
ten you have in the world."
"So, a rich man? No; you smiled -- a rich woman. Now we
have got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the
tenner."
"I'll see you in hell first."
"Oh, Susan! Language!"
"I am clearing out of here. I've had enough of you all. I'll
send for my box to-morrow." She flounced for the door.
"Good-bye, Susan. Paregoric is the stuff.... Now," he
continued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door
had closed behind the flushed and angry woman, "this gang
means business. Look how close they play the game. Your letter
to me had the 10 P.M. postmark. And yet Susan passes the word
to Barney. Barney has time to go to his employer and get
instructions; he or she -- I incline to the latter from Susan's grin
when she thought I had blundered -- forms a plan. Black Steve is
called in, and I am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning.
That's quick work, you know."
"But what do they want?"
"Yes, that's the question. Who had the house before you?"
"A retired sea captain called Ferguson."
"Anything remarkable about him?"
"Not that ever I heard of."
"I was wondering whether he could have buried something.
Of course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the
Post-Office bank. But there are always some lunatics about. It
would be a dull world without them. At first I thought of some
buried valuable. But why, in that case, should they want your
furniture? You don't happen to have a Raphael or a first folio
Shakespeare without knowing it?"
"No, I don't think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby
tea-set."
"That would hardly justify all this mystery. Besides, why
should they not openly state what they want? If they covet your
tea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you
out, lock, stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is something
which you do not know that you have, and which you would not
give up if you did know."
"That is how I read it," said I.
"Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it."
"Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?"
"Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get
it to a finer point. You have been in this house a year."
"Nearly two."
"All the better. During this long period no one wants anything
from you. Now suddenly within three or four days you have
urgent demands. What would you gather from that?"
"It can only mean," said I, "that the object, whatever it may
be, has only just come into the house."
"Settled once again," said Holmes. "Now, Mrs. Maberley
has any object just arrived?"
"No, I have bought nothing new this year."
"Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think we had best
let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. Is
that lawyer of yours a capable man?"
"Mr. Sutro is most capable."
"Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just
banged your front door alone?"
"I have a young girl."
"Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. You
might possibly want protection."
"Against whom?"
"Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure. If I can't find
what they are after, I must approach the matter from the other
end and try to get at the principal. Did this house-agent man give
any address?"
"Simply his card and occupation. Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer
and Valuer."
"I don't think we shall find him in the directory. Honest
business men don't conceal their place of business. Well, you
will let me know any fresh development. I have taken up your
case, and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through."
As we passed through the hall Holmes's eyes, which missed
nothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled
in a corner. The labels shone out upon them.
" 'Milano.' 'Lucerne.' These are from Italy."
"They are poor Douglas's things."
"You have not unpacked them? How long have you had
them?"
"They arrived last week."
"But you said -- why, surely this might be the missing link.
How do we know that there is not something of value there?"
"There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had
only his pay and a small annuity. What could he have of value?"
Holmes was lost in thought.
"Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley," he said at last. "Have
these things taken upstairs to your bedroom. Examine them as
soon as possible and see what they cohtain. I will come to-
morrow and hear your report."
It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very
close surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the
end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the
shadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and
menacing figure he looked in that lonely place. Holmes clapped
his hand to his pocket.
"Lookin' for your gun, Masser Holmes?"
"No, for my scent-bottle, Steve."
"You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain't you?"
"It won't be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. I gave
you fair warning this morning."
"Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said,
and I don't want no more talk about that affair of Masser
Perkins. S'pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will."
"Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job."
"So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told you the truth
before. I don't know. My boss Barney gives me orders and that's
all."
"Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house,
and everything under that roof, is under my protection. Don't
forget it."
"All right, Masser Holmes. I'll remember."
"I've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Wat-
son," Holmes remarked as we walked on. "I think he would
double-cross his employer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I
had some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve
was one of them. Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike,
and I am going to see him now. When I get back I may be
clearer in the matter."
I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well
imagine how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human
book of reference upon all matters of social scandal. This
strange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow
window of a St. James's Street club and was the receiving-
station as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the
metropolis. He made, it was said, a four-figure income by
the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the gar-
bage papers which cater to an inquisitive public. If ever, far
down in the turbid depths of London life, there was some
strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exact-
ness by this human dial upon the surface. Holmes discreetly
helped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in
turn.
When I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was
conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a
most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of
the following telegram.

Please come out at once. Client's house burgled in the
night. Police in possession.
SUTRO.
Holmes whistled. "The drama has come to a crisis, and
quicker than I had expected. There is a great driving-power at
the back of this business, Watson, which does not surprise me
after what I have heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I
made a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend the night on
guard. This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. Well, there
is nothing for it but another journey to Harrow Weald."
We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to
the orderly household of the previous day. A small group of
idlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of
constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds.
Within we met a gray old gentleman, who introduced himself as
the lawyer together with a bustling, rubicund inspector, who
greeted Hoimes as an old friend.
"Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I'm
afraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the
capacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply."
"I am sure the case is in very good hands," said Holmes.
"Merely a common burglary, you say?"
"Quite so. We know pretty well who the men are and where
to find them. It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big
nigger in it -- they've been seen about here."
"Excellent! What did they get?"
"Well, they don't seem to have got much. Mrs. Maberley was
chloroformed and the house was -- Ah! here is the lady herself."
Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered
the room, leaning upon a little maidservant.
"You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes," said she, smiling
ruefully. "Alas, I did not take it! I did not wish to trouble Mr.
Sutro, and so I was unprotected."
"I only heard of it this morning," the lawyer explained.
"Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. I
neglected his advice, and I have paid for it."
"You look wretchedly ill," said Holmes. "Perhaps you are
hardly equal to telling me what occurred."
"It is all here," said the inspector, tapping a bulky notebook.
"Still, if the lady is not too exhausted --"
"There is really so little to tell. I have no doubt that wicked
Susan had planned an entrance for them. They must have known
the house to an inch. I was conscious for a moment of the
chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but I have no
notion how long I may have been senseless. When I woke, one
man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in
his hand from among my son's baggage, which was partially
opened and littered over the floor. Before he could get away I
sprang up and seized him."
"You took a big risk," said the inspector.
"I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have
struck me, for I can remember no more. Mary the maid heard the
noise and began screaming out of the window. That brought the
police, but the rascals had got away."
"What did they take?"
"Well, I don't think there is anything of value missing. I am
sure there was nothing in my son's trunks."
"Did the men leave no clue?"
"There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from
the man that I grasped. It was lying all crumpled on the floor. It
is in my son's handwriting."
"Which means that it is not of much use," said the inspector.
"Now if it had been in the burglar's --"
"Exactly," said Holmes. "What rugged common sense! None
the less, I should be curious to see it."
The inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his
pocketbook.
"I never pass anything, however trifling," said he with some
pomposity. "That is my advice to you, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-
five years' experience I have learned my lesson. There is always
the chance of finger-marks or something."
Holmes inspected the sheet of paper.
"What do you make of it, Inspector?"
"Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can
see."
"It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale," said
Holmes. "You have noticed the number on the top of the page.
It is two hundred and forty-five. Where are the odd two hundred
and forty-four pages?"
"Well, I suppose the burglars got those. Much good may it do
them!"
"It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal
such papers as that. Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector?"
"Yes, sir, it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just
grabbed at what came first to hand. I wish them joy of what they
got."
"Why should they go to my son's things?" asked Mrs.
Maberley.
"Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried
their luck upstairs. That is how I read it. What do you make of
it, Mr. Holmes?"
"I must think it over, Inspector. Come to the window, Wat-
son." Then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of
paper. It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this:

". . . face bled considerably from the cuts and blows,
but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that
lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to
sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humilia-
tion. She smiled -- yes, by Heaven! she smiled, like the
heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. It was at
that moment that love died and hate was born. Man must
live for something. If it is not for your embrace, my lady,
then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete
revenge."

"Queer grammar!" said Holmes with a smile as he handed the
paper back to the inspector. "Did you notice how the 'he'
suddenly changed to 'my'? The writer was so carried away by
his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to
be the hero."
"It seemed mighty poor stuff," said the inspector as he re-
placed it in his book. "What! are you off, Mr. Holmes?"
"I don't think there is anything more for me to do now that
the case is in such capable hands. By the way, Mrs. Maberley,
did you say you wished to travel?"
"It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes."
"Where would you like to go -- Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?"
"Oh if I had the money I would go round the world."
"Quite so. Round the world. Well, good-morning. I may drop
you a line in the evening." As we passed the window I caught a
glimpse of the inspector's smile and shake of the head. "These
clever fellows have always a touch of madness." That was what
I read in the inspector's smile.
"Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,"
said Holmes when we were back in the roar of central London
once more. "I think we had best clear the matter up at once, and
it would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to
have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora
Klein."
We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in
Grosvenor Square. Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he
roused himself suddenly.
"By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly?"
"No, I can't say that I do. I only gather that we are going to
see the lady who is behind all this mischief."
"Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to
you? She was, of course, the celebrated beauty. There was never
a woman to touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the
masterfui Conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in
Pernambuco for generations. She married the aged German sugar
king, Klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the
most lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an interval of
adventure when she pleased her own tastes. She had several
lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of the most striking men in
London, was one of them. It was by all accounts more than an
adventure with him. He was not a society butterfly but a strong,
proud man who gave and expected all. But she is the 'belle dame
sans merci' of fiction. When her caprice is satisfied the matter is
ended, and if the other party in the matter can't take her word
for it she knows how to bring it home to him."
"Then that was his own story --"
"Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear that she is about
to marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her
son. His Grace's ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal
would be a different matter, so it is imperative -- Ah! here we
are."
It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End. A
machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word
that the lady was not at home. "Then we shall wait until she is,"
said Holmes cheerfully.
The machine broke down.
"Not at home means not at home to you," said the footman.
"Good," Holmes answered. "That means that we shall not
have to wait. Kindly give this note to your mistress."
He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook,
folded it, and handed it to the man.
"What did you say, Holmes?" I asked.
"I simply wrote: 'Shall it be the police, then?' I think that
should pass us in."
It did -- with amazing celerity. A minute later we were in an
Arabian Nights drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half
gloom, picked out with an occasional pink electric light. The
lady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest
beauty finds the half light more welcome. She rose from a settee
as we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like
face, with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at
us both.
"What is this intrusion -- and this insulting message?" she
asked, holding up the slip of paper.
"I need not explain, madame. I have too much respect for
your intelligence to do so -- though I confess that intelligence has
been surprisingly at fault of late."
"How so, sir?"
"By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from
my work. Surely no man would take up my profession if it were
not that danger attracts him. It was you, then, who forced me to
examine the case of young Maberley."
"I have no idea what you are talking about. What have I to do
with hired bullies?"
Holmes turned away wearily.
"Yes, I have underrated your intelligence. Well, good-after-
noon!"
"Stop! Where are you going?"
"To Scotland Yard."
We had not got halfway to the door before she had overtaken
us and was holding his arm. She had turned in a moment from
steel to velvet.
"Come and sit down, gentlemen. Let us talk this matter over.
I feel that I may be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. You have the
feelings of a gentleman. How quick a woman's instinct is to find
it out. I will treat you as a friend."
"I cannot promise to reciprocate, madame. I am not the law,
but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go. I am ready
to listen, and then I will tell you how I will act."
"No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like
yourself."
"What was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed
yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or
give you away."
"No, no! I am not so simple. Since I have promised to be
frank, I may say that no one, save Barney Stockdale and Susan,
his wife, have the least idea who their employer is. As to them,
well, it is not the first --" She smiled and nodded with a
charming coquettish intimacy.
"l see. You've tested them before."
"They are good hounds who run silent."
"Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand
that feeds them. They will be arrested for this burglary. The
police are already after them."
"They will take what comes to them. That is what they are
paid for. I shall not appear in the matter."
"Unless I bring you into it."
"No, no, you would not. You are a gentleman. It is a wom-
an's secret."
"In the first place, you must give back this manuscript."
She broke into a ripple of laughter and walked to the fireplace.
There was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker.
"Shall I give this back?" she asked. So roguish and exquisite
did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that
I felt of all Holmes's criminals this was the one whom he would
find it hardest to face. However, he was immune from sentiment.
"That seals your fate," he said coldly. "You are very prompt
in your actions, madame, but you have overdone it on this
occasion."
She threw the poker down with a clatter.
"How hard you are!" she cried. "May I tell you the whole
story?"
"I fancy I could tell it to you."
"But you must look at it with my eyes, Mr. Holmes. You
must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all
her life's ambition about to be ruined at the last moment. Is such
a woman to be blamed if she protects herself?"
"The original sin was yours."
"Yes, yes! I admit it. He was a dear boy, Douglas, but it so
chanced that he could not fit into my plans. He wanted marriage --
marriage, Mr. Holmes -- with a penniless commoner. Nothing
less would serve him. Then he became pertinacious. Because I
had given he seemed to think that I still must give, and to him
only. It was intolerable. At last I had to make him realize it."
"By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window."
"You do indeed seem to know everything. Well, it is true.
Barney and the boys drove him away, and were, I admit, a little
rough in doing so. But what did he do then? Could I have
believed that a gentleman would do such an act? He wrote a
book in which he described his own story. I, of course, was the
wolf; he the lamb. It was all there, under different names, of
course; but who in all London would have failed to recognize it?
What do you say to that, Mr. Holmes?"
"Well, he was within his rights."
"It was as if the air of Italy had got into his blood and brought
with it the old cruel Italian spirit. He wrote to me and sent me a
copy of his book that I might have the torture of anticipation.
There were two copies, he said -- one for me, one for his
publisher."
"How did you know the publisher's had not reached him?"
"I knew who his publisher was. It is not his only novel, you
know. I found out that he had not heard from Italy. Then came
Douglas's sudden death. So long as that other manuscript was in
the world there was no safety for me. Of course, it must be
among his effects, and these would be returned to his mother. I
set the gang at work. One of them got into the house as servant.
I wanted to do the thing honestly. I really and truly did. I was
ready to buy the house and everything in it. I offered any price
she cared to ask. I only tried the other way when everything else
had failed. Now, Mr. Holmes, granting that I was too hard on
Douglas -- and, God knows, I am sorry for it! -- what else could I
do with my whole future at stake?"
Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
"Well, well," said he, "I suppose I shall have to compound a
felony as usual. How much does it cost to go round the world in
first-class style?"
The lady stared in amazement.
"Could it be done on five thousand pounds?"
"Well, I should think so, indeed!"
"Very good. I think you will sign me a check for that, and I
will see that it comes to Mrs. Maberley. You owe her a little
change of air. Meantime, lady" -- he wagged a cautionary
forefinger -- "have a care! Have a care! You can't play with
edged tools forever without cutting those dainty hands."

THE THREE LITTLE PIGS

Once upon a time . . . there were three little pigs, who left their mummy
and daddy to see the world.
All summer long, they roamed through the woods and over the plains,playing
games and having fun. None were happier than the three little pigs, and they
easily made friends with everyone. Wherever they went, they were given a warm
welcome, but as summer drew to a close, they realized that folk were drifting
back to their usual jobs, and preparing for winter. Autumn came and it began
to rain. The three little pigs started to feel they needed a real home. Sadly
they knew that the fun was over now and they must set to work like the others,
or they'd be left in the cold and rain, with no roof over their heads. They
talked about what to do, but each decided for himself. The laziest little pig
said he'd build a straw hut.
"It wlll only take a day,' he said. The others disagreed.
"It's too fragile," they said disapprovingly, but he refused to listen. Not
quite so lazy, the second little pig went in search of planks of seasoned
wood.
"Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!" It took him two days to nail them together. But the
third little pig did not like the wooden house.
"That's not the way to build a house!" he said. "It takes time, patience
and hard work to buiid a house that is strong enough to stand up to wind,
rain, and snow, and most of all, protect us from the wolf!"
The days went by, and the wisest little pig's house took shape, brick by
brick. From time to time, his brothers visited him, saying with a chuckle:
"Why are you working so hard? Why don't you come and play?" But the
stubborn bricklayer pig just said "no".
"I shall finish my house first. It must be solid and sturdy. And then I'll
come and play!" he said. "I shall not be foolish like you! For he who laughs
last, laughs longest!"
It was the wisest little pig that found the tracks of a big wolf in the
neighbourhood.
The little pigs rushed home in alarm. Along came the wolf, scowling
fiercely at the laziest pig's straw hut.
"Come out!" ordered the wolf, his mouth watering. I want to speak to you!"
"I'd rather stay where I am!" replied the little pig in a tiny voice.
"I'll make you come out!" growled the wolf angrily, and puffing out his
chest, he took a very deep breath. Then he blew wlth all his might, right onto
the house. And all the straw the silly pig had heaped against some thin poles,
fell down in the great blast. Excited by his own cleverness, the wolf did not
notice that the little pig had slithered out from underneath the heap of
straw, and was dashing towards his brother's wooden house. When he realized
that the little pig was escaping, the wolf grew wild with rage.
"Come back!" he roared, trying to catch the pig as he ran into the wooden
house. The other little pig greeted his brother, shaking like a leaf.
"I hope this house won't fall down! Let's lean against the door so he can't
break in!"
Outside, the wolf could hear the little pigs' words. Starving as he was, at
the idea of a two-course meal, he rained blows on the door.
"Open up! Open up! I only want to speak to you!"
Inside, the two brothers wept in fear and did their best to hold the door
fast against the blows. Then the furious wolf braced himself a new effort: he
drew in a really enormous breath, and went ... WHOOOOO! The wooden house
collapsed like a pack of cards.
Luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window
of his own brick house, and he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing
brothers. And not a moment too soon, for the wolf was already hammering
furiously on the door. This time, the wolf had grave doubts. This house had a
much more solid air than the others. He blew once, he blew again and then for
a third time. But all was in vain. For the house did not budge an lnch. The
three little pigs watched him and their fear began to fade. Quite exhausted by
his efforts, the wolf decided to try one of his tricks. He scrambled up a
nearby ladder, on to the roof to have a look at the chimney. However, the
wisest little pig had seen thls ploy, and he quickly said:
"Quick! Light the fire!" With his long legs thrust down the chimney, the
wolf was not sure if he should slide down the black hole. It wouldn'tbe easy
to get in, but the sound of the little pigs' voices below only made him feel
hungrier.
"I'm dying of hunger! I'm goin to try and get down." And he let himself
drop. But landing was rather hot, too hot! The wolf landed in the fire, stunned
by his fall.
The flames licked his hairy coat and his tail became a flaring torch.
"Never again! Never again will I go down a chimneyl" he squealed, as he
tried to put out the flames in his tail. Then he ran away as fast as he could.
The three happy little pigs, dancing round and round the yard, began to
sing:
"Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The wicked black wolf will never come back...!"
From that terrible day on, the wisest little pig's brothers set to work
with a will. In less than no time, up went the two new brick houses. The wolf
did return once to roam in the neighbourhood, but when he caught sight of
three chimneys, he remembered the terrible pain of a burnt tail, and he left
for good.
Now safe and happy, the wisest little pig called to his brothers:
"No more work! Come on, let's go and play!"

The Adventure of the Three Students

It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I
need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend
some weeks in one of our great university towns, and it was
during this time that the small but instructive adventure which I
am about to relate befell us. It will be obvious that any details
which would help the reader exactly to identify the college or the
criminal would be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scan-
dal may well be allowed to die out. With due discretion the
incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to
illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was re-
markable. I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms
as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give
a clue as to the people concerned.
We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a
library where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious
researches in early English charters -- researches which led to
results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my
future narratives. Here it was that one evening we received a
visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton Soames, tutor and lec-
turer at the College of St. Luke's. Mr. Soames was a tall, spare
man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had always
known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular
occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it
was clear something very unusual had occurred.
"I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of
your valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St.
Luke's, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in
town, I should have been at a loss what to do."
"I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions," my
friend answered. "I should much prefer that you called in the aid
of the police."
"No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible.
When once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this
is just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is
most essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known
as your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can
help me. I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can."
My friend's temper had not improved since he had been
deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without
his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was
an uncomfortable man. He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious
acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much
excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.
"I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the
first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am
one of the examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the
papers consists of a large passage of Greek translation which the
candidate has not seen. This passage is printed on the examina-
tion paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if
the candidate could prepare it in advance. For this reason, great
care is taken to keep the paper secret.
"To-day, about three o'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived
from the printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of
Thucydides. I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be
absolutely correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed.
I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I
left the proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an
hour.
"You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are
double -- a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without.
As I approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it.
For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on
feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right. The only
duplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which
belonged to my servant, Bannister -- a man who has looked after
my room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above
suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that he had
entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very
carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to
my room must have been within a very few minutes of my
leaving it. His forgetfulness about the key would have mattered
little upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has pro-
duced the most deplorable consequences.
"The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone
had rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long
slips. I had left them all together. Now, I found that one of them
was lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the
window, and the third was where I had left it."
Holmes stirred for the first time.
"The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the
third where you left it," said he.
"Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possi-
bly know that?"
"Pray continue your very interesting statement."
"For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpar-
donable liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however,
with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was
speaking the truth. The alternative was that someone passing had
observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had
entered to look at the papers. A large sum of money is at stake,
for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous
man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage
over his fellows.
"Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had
nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly
been tampered with. I gave him a little brandy and left him
collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of
the room. I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his
presence besides the rumpled papers. On the table in the window
were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. A
broken tip of lead was lying there also. Evidently the rascal had
copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had
been compelled to put a fresh point to it."
"Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-
humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
"Fortune has been your friend."
"This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine
surface of red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannis-
ter, that it was smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in
it about three inches long -- not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.
Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black
dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like saw-
dust in it. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man
who rifled the papers. There were no footmarks and no other
evidence as to his identity. I was at my wit's end, when suddenly
the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and
I came straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do help
me, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilemma. Either I must find the
man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers
are prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation,
there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not
only on the college, but on the university. Above all things, I
desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly."
"I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice
as I can," said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat.
"The case is not entirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited
you in your room after the papers came to you?"
"Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student, who lives on the
same stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the exami-
nation."
"For which he was entered?"
"Yes."
"And the papers were on your table?"
"To the best of my belief, they were rolled up."
"But might be recognized as proofs?"
"Possibly."
"No one else in your room?"
"No."
"Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?"
"No one save the printer."
"Did this man Bannister know?"
"No, certainly not. No one knew."
"Where is Bannister now?"
"He was very ill, poor fellow. I left him collapsed in the
chair. I was in such a hurry to come to you."
"You left your door open?"
"I locked up the papers first."
"Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames: that, unless the Indian
student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tam-
pered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing
that they were there."
"So it seems to me."
Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.
"Well," said he. "let us go round. Not one of your cases.
Watson -- mental, not physical. All right; come if you want to.
Now, Mr. Soames -- at your disposal!"
The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed
window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college.
A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. On the
ground floor was the tutor's room. Above were three students,
one on each story. It was already twilight when we reached the
scene of our problem. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the
window. Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his
neck craned, he looked into the room.
"He must have entered through the door. There is no opening
except the one pane," said our learned guide.
"Dear me!" said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as
he glanced at our companion. "Well, if there is nothing to be
learned here, we had best go inside."
The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his
room. We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examina-
tion of the carpet.
"I am afraid there are no signs here," said he. "One could
hardly hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to
have quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say. Which
chair?"
"By the window there."
"I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have
finished with the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of
course, what has happened is very clear. The man entered and
took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. He
carried them over to the window table, because from there he
could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect
an escape."
"As a matter of fact, he could not," said Soames, "for I
entered by the side door."
"Ah, that's good! Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. Let
me see the three strips. No finger impressions -- no! Well he
carried over this one first, and he copied it. How long wouid it
take him to do that, using every possible contraction? A quarter
of an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and seized the next.
He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make
a very hurried retreat -- very hurried, since he had not time to
replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.
You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you
entered the outer door?"
"No, I can't say I was."
"Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and
had, as you observe, to sharpen it again. This is of interest,
Watson. The pencil was not an ordinary one. It was above the
usual size, with a soft lead, the outer colour was dark blue, the
maker's name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece
remaining is only about an inch and a half long. Look for such a
pencil, Mr. Soames, and you have got your man. When I add
that he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an
additional aid."
Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of
information. "I can follow the other points," said he, "but
really, in this matter of the length --"
Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space
of clear wood after them.
"You see?"
"No, I fear that even now --"
"Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are
others. What could this NN be? It is at the end of a word. You
are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name.
Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as
usually follows the Johann?" He held the small table sideways to
the electric light. "I was hoping that if the paper on which he
wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this
polished surface. No, I see nothing. I don't think there is any-
thing more to be learned here. Now for the central table. This
small pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of.
Roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As
you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this
is very interesting. And the cut -- a positive tear, I see. It began
with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much
indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr.
Soames. Where does that door lead to?"
"To my bedroom."
"Have you been in it since your adventure?"
"No, I came straight away for you."
"I should like to have a glance round. What a charming,
old-fashioned room! Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until
I have examined the floor. No, I see nothing. What about this
curtain? You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were forced
to conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed
is too low and the wardrobe too shallow. No one there, I
suppose?"
As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little
rigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an
emergency. As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed
nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of
pegs. Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor.
"Halloa! What's this?" said he.
It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like
the one upon the table of the study. Holmes held it out on his
open palm in the glare of the electric light.
"Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as
well as in your sitting-room, Mr. Soames."
"What could he have wanted there?"
"I think it is clear enough. You came back by an unexpected
way, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door.
What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray
him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself."
"Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all
the time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man
prisoner if we had only known it?"
"So I read it."
"Surely there is another alternative, Mr. Holmes. I don't
know whether you observed my bedroom window?"
"Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one
swinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man."
"Exactly. And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as
to be partly invisible. The man might have effected his entrance
there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally,
finding the door open, have escaped that way."
Holmes shook his head impatiently.
"Let us be practical," said he. "I understand you to say that
there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of
passing your door?"
"Yes, there are."
"And they are all in for this examination?"
"Yes."
"Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than
the others?"
Soames hesitated.
"It is a very delicate question." said he. "One hardly likes to
throw suspicion where there are no proofs."
"Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs."
"I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three
mcn who inhabit these rooms. The lower of the three is Gilchrist,
a fine scholar and athletc, plays in the Rugby team and the
cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and
the long jump. He is a fine, manly fellow. His father was the
notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf. My
scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and
industrious. He will do well.
"The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. He
is a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are. He is
well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is
steady and methodical.
"The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He is a brilliant
fellow when he chooses to work -- one of the brightest intellects
of the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprinci-
pled. He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first
year. He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward
with dread to the examination."
"Then it is he whom you suspect?"
"I dare not go so far as that. But, of the three, he is perhaps the
least unlikely."
"Exactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look at your
servant, Bannister."
He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fel-
low of fifty. He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance
of the quiet routine of his life. His plump face was twitching
with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.
"We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister," said
his master.
"Yes, sir."
"I understand," said Holmes, "that you left your key in the
door?"
"Yes, sir."
"Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the
very day when there were these papers inside?"
"It was most unfortunate. sir. But I have occasionally done
the same thing at other times."
"When did you enter the room?"
It was about half-past four. That is Mr. Soames's tea time."
"How long did you stay?"
"When I saw that he was absent. I withdrew at once."
"Did you look at these papers on the table?"
"No, sir certainly not."
"How came you to leave the key in the door?"
"I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I would come back
for the key. Then I forgot."
"Has the outer door a spring lock?"
"No, sir."
"Then it was open all the time?"
"Yes, sir."
"Anyone in the room could get out?"
"Yes, sir."
"When Mr. Soames returned and called for you, you were
very much disturbed?"
"Yes, sir. Such a thing has never happened during the many
years that I have been here. I nearly fainted, sir."
"So I understand. Where were you when you began to feel
bad?"
"Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door."
"That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over
yonder near the corner. Why did you pass these other chairs?"
"I don't know, sir, it didn't matter to me where I sat."
"I really don't think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes. He
was looking very bad -- quite ghastly."
"You stayed here when your master left?"
"Only for a minute or so. Then I locked the door and went to
my room."
"Whom do you suspect?"
"Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. I don't believe there is
any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by
such an action. No, sir, I'll not believe it."
"Thank you, that will do," said Holmes. "Oh, one more
word. You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen
whom you attend that anything is amiss?"
"No, sir -- not a word."
"You haven't seen any of them?"
"No, sir."
"Very good. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a walk in the
quadrangle, if you please."
Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering
gloom.
"Your three birds are all in their nests," said Holmes, looking
up. "Halloa! What's that? One of them seems restless enough."
It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly
upon his blind. He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.
"I should like to have a peep at each of them," said Holmes.
"Is it possible?"
"No difficulty in the world," Soames answered. "This set of
rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for
visitors to go over them. Come along, and I will personally
conduct you."
"No names, please!" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's
door. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and
made us welcome when he understood our errand. There were
some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture
within. Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted
on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow
one from our host, and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his
own. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of
the Indian -- a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us
askance, and was obviously glad when Holmes's architectural
studies had come to an end. I could not see that in either case
Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.
Only at the third did our visit prove abortive. The outer door
would not open to our knock, and-nothing more substantial than
a torrent of bad language came from behind it. "I don't care who
you are. You can go to blazes!" roared the angry voice. "To-
morrow's the exam, and I won't be drawn by anyone."
"A rude fellow," said our guide, flushing with anger as we
withdrew down the stair. "Of course, he did not realize that it
was I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very
uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather
suspicious."
Holmes's response was a curious one.
"Can you tell me his exact height?" he asked.
"Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller
than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six
would be about it."
"That is very important," said Holmes. "And now, Mr.
Soames, I wish you good-night."
Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. "Good
gracious, Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in
this abrupt fashion! You don't seem to realize the position.
To-morrow is the examination. I must take some definite action
to-night. I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the
papers has been tampered with. The situation must be faced."
"You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow
morning and chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in
a position then to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile,
you change nothing -- nothing at all."
"Very good, Mr. Holmes."
"You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly
find some way out of your difficulties. I will take the black clay
with me, also the pencil cuttings. Good-bye."
When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again
looked up at the windows. The Indian still paced his room. The
others were invisible.
"Well, Watson, what do you think of it?" Holmes asked, as
we came out into the main street. "Quite a little parlour game --
sort of three-card trick, is it not? There are your three men. It
must be one of them. You take your choice. Which is yours?"
"The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the one with the
worst record. And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also. Why
should he be pacing his room all the time?"
"There is nothing in that. Many men do it when they are
trying to learn anything by heart."
"He looked at us in a queer way."
"So would you, if a flock of strangers came in on you when
you were preparing for an examination next day, and every
moment was of value. No, I see nothing in that. Pencils, too,
and knives -- all was satisfactory. But that fellow does puzzle
me."
"Who?"
"Why, Bannister, the servant. What's his game in the matter?"
"He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man."
"So he did me. That's the puzzling part. Why should a
perfectly honest man -- Well, well, here's a large stationer's. We
shall begin our researches here."
There were only four stationers of any consequences in the
town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid
high for a duplicate. All were agreed that one could be ordered,
but that it was not a usual size of pencil, and that it was seldom
kept in stock. My friend did not appear to be depressed by his
failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.
"No good, my dear Watson. This, the best and only final
clue, has run to nothing. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we
can build up a sufficient case without it. By Jove! my dear
fellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas
at seven-thirty. What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and
your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to
quit, and that I shall share your downfall -- not, however, before
we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless
servant, and the three enterprising students."
Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though
he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. At
eight in the morning, he came into my room just as I finished my
toilet.
"Well, Watson," said he, "it is time we went down to St.
Luke's. Can you do without breakfast?"
"Certainly."
"Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell
him something positive."
"Have you anything positive to tell him?"
"I think so."
"You have formed a conclusion?"
"Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery."
"But what fresh evidence could you have got?"
"Aha! It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of
bed at the untimely hour of six. I have put in two hours' hard
work and covered at least five miles, with something to show for
it. Look at that!"
He held out his hand. On the palm were three little pyramids
of black, doughy clay.
"Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday."
"And one more this morning. It is a fair argument that
wherever No. 3 came from is also the source of Nos. 1 and 2.
Eh, Watson? Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his
pain."
The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agita-
tion when we found him in his chambers. In a few hours the
examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma
between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to
compete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still,
so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes
with two eager hands outstretched.
"Thank heaven that you have come! I feared that you had
given it up in despair. What am I to do? Shall the examination
proceed?"
"Yes, let it proceed, by all means."
"But this rascal?"
"He shall not compete."
"You know him?"
"I think so. If this matter is not to become public. we must
give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small
private court-martial. You there, if you please, Soames! Watson
you here! I'll take the armchair in the middle. I think that we are
now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast.
Kindly ring the bell!"
Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear
at our judicial appearance.
"You will kindly close the door," said Holmes. "Now
Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday's
incident.'
The man turned white to the roots of his hair.
"I have told you everything, sir."
"Nothing to add?"
"Nothing at all, sir."
"Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you. When you
sat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to
conceal some object which would have shown who had been in
the room?"
Bannister's face was ghastly.
"No, sir, certainly not."
"It is only a suggestion," said Holmes, suavely. "I frankly
admit that I am unable to prove it. But it seems probable enough
since the moment that Mr. Soames's back was turned, you
released the man who was hiding in that bedroom."
Bannister licked his dry lips.
"There was no man, sir."
"Ah, that's a pity, Bannister. Up to now you may have
spoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied."
The man's face set in sullen defiance.
"There was no man, sir."
"Come, come, Bannister!"
"No, sir, there was no one."
"In that case, you can give us no further information. Would
you please remain in the room? Stand over there near the bed-
room door. Now, Soames, I am going to ask you to have the
great kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist. and to
ask him to step down into yours."
An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the
student. He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with
a springy step and a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes
glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of
blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.
"Just close the door," said Holmes. "Now, Mr. Gilchrist, we
are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of
what passes between us. We can be perfectly frank with each
other. We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an honourable
man, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday?"
The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look
full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
"No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word -- never one
word!" cried the servant.
"No, but you have now," said Holmes. "Now, sir, you must
see that after Bannister's words your position is hopeless, and
that your only chance lies in a frank confession."
For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control
his writhing features. The next he had thrown himself on his
knees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had
burst into a storm of passionate sobbing.
"Come, come," said Holmes, kindly, "it is human to err,
and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames
what occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong. Shall I
do so? Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I
do you no injustice.
"From the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said to me that no
one, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in
your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind.
The printer one could, of course, dismiss. He could examine the
papers in his own office. The Indian I also thought nothing of. If
the proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they
were. On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence
that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on
that very day the papers were on the table. I dismissed that. The
man who entered knew that the papers were there. How did he
know?
"When I approached your room, I examined the window. You
amused me by supposing that I was contemplating the possibility
of someone having in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these
opposite rooms, forced himself through it. Such an idea was
absurd. I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in
order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.
I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less
than that would have a chance. Already you see I had reason to
think that, if one of your three students was a man of unusual
height, he was the most worth watching of the three.
"I entered, and I took you into my confidencc as to the
suggestions of the side table. Of the centre table I could make
nothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that
he was a long-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came to me
in an instant, and I only needed certain corroborative proofs,
which I speedily obtained.
"What happened was this: This young fellow had employed
his afternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practis-
ing the jump. He returned carrying his jumping-shoes, which are
provided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes. As he
passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these
proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were. No
harm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed
your door, he perceived the key which had been left by the
carelessness of your servant. A sudden impulse came over him to
enter, and see if they were indeed the proofs. It was not a
dangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply
looked in to ask a question.
"Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was
then that he yielded to temptation. He put his shoes on the table.
What was it you put on that chair near the window?"
"Gloves," said the young man.
Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. "He put his gloves
on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy
them. He thought the tutor must return by the main gate, and that
he would see him. As we know, he came back by the side gate.
Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible
escape. He forgot his gloves, but he caught up his shoes and
darted into the bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that
table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the
bedroom door. That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe
had been drawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken
refuge there. The earth round the spike had been left on the
table, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bed-
room. I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this
morning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-
pit, and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the
fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete
from slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?"
The student had drawn himself erect.
"Yes, sir, it is true," said he.
"Good heavens! have you nothing to add?" cried Soames.
"Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure
has bewildered me. I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I
wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.
It was before I knew that my sin had found me out. Here it is,
sir. You will see that I have said, 'I have determined not to go
in for the examination. I have been offered a commission in
the Rhodesian Police, and I am going out to South Africa at
once.' "
"I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit
by your unfair advantage," said Soames. "But why did you
change your purpose?"
Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.
"There is the man who set me in the right path," said he.
"Come now, Bannister," said Holmes. "It will be clear to
you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this
young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have
locked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that
window, it was incredible. Can you not clear up the last point in
this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?"
"It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with
all your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know. Time
was, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young
gentleman's father. When he was ruined I came to the college as
servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was
down in the world. I watched his son all I could for the sake of
the old days. Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday,
when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was Mr.
Gilchrist's tan gloves a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves
well, and I understood their message. If Mr. Soames saw them,
the game was up. I flopped down into that chair, and nothing
would budge me until Mr. Soames went for you. Then out came
my poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and
confessed it all to me. Wasn't it natural, sir, that I should save
him, and wasn't it natural also that I should try to speak to him
as his dead father would have done, and make him understand
that he could not profit by such a deed? Could you blame me,
sir?"
"No, indeed," said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.
"Well, Soames, I think we have cleared your little problem up,
and our breakfast awaits us at home. Come, Watson! As to you,
sir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in Rhodesia. For once
you have fallen low. Let us see, in the future, how high you can
rise."
